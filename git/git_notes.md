## Terminology
**Git**
Is the local VCS on your machine

**Github**
The central system for hosting your files online for others to see and use with Git


## What is a Version Control System?
It tracks changes to a specific resource over time.
Things like Google Docs also have VCS, but slightly different.

The VCS works specifically not by saving all unique versions but by **tracking changes** - so a specific version can be generated by understanding all of the changes made since the original (similar to database change logs work).

Systems like Git work locally first - Git tracks changes on your computer to the files that you want tracked.
Most systems now also have a distributed system (e.g., GitHub) that allows all users to have the complete source code (clone), and a central server also has this source code. This allows greater durability of the code (in case of one computer crashing) and also allows collaboration.

## Very brief history of Git
Before 2005, BitKeeper was used by the Linux community - but then the free license was revoked which led to Git being developed.

## What is Git?
Git is for tracking changes in any set of files at speed. It is distributed and focuses on data integrity and supports non-linear workflows.

## Git Completion (optional)
Git completion is an optional - but handy tool that allows you to use the 'tab' key to auto-complete your git commands in the terminal.
Source code found here: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
By copying this bash into our `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions` folder, we can get this file to run whenever we run a terminal - and therefore allow completion of our git commands.

```
#Download git completion file and save it in a random folder (made a bash_custom folder on home for convenience)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.bash_custom/.git-completion.bash
```

## Git Configuration
There are 3 levels of git configuration:
- System: `/etc/gitconfig`
  - We can set system config with `git config --system`
- User: `~/.config/git/config` or `~/.gitconfig`
  - We can set user config with `git config --global`
- Project: `.git/config`
  - We can set project config with `git config --local`

```
#List out user config:
git config --global -l

#List out project config:
git config --global -l

#List out all configurations:
git config -l
```

**Some commonly set configurations and what they mean:**
- user.email = what email will be used to sign off your git commits
- core.editor = base core editor. If you don't enter a commit message, for example, git will open this editor and ask you to enter the commit message there.
